# USER REGISTERATIOIN PORTAL

This is a simple user registeration portal where new users will have to register on the signup page, providing their Username, Email, Password.
A search is then made on the Data Base (DB) to enusure the user profile is not already on the DB, nor has the username already been used by another user. If the new User doesn't already exist, a new profile is created for them.
If it does exist they are prompted to make corrections where needed with the explanatory error messages.

If it is an existing user, they are going to move to the login page and sign in with their details. Upon successful retrieval of their information from the DB, they moved on to the Home Page.
